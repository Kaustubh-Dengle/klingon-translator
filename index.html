            The Klingon language is the language spoken by the fictional Klingons in the Star Trek universe. Within the fictional universe of Star Trek, klingon is derived from the original language spoken by the messianic figure Kahless the Unforgettable, who united the Klingon home-world of QoʼnoS under one empire more than 1500 years ago. Many dialects exist, but the standardized dialect of prestige is almost invariably that of the sitting emperor.

            The Vulcan language is a fictional language in the Star Trek universe. Vulcan names as spoken and written among non-Vulcans were, at best, only approximations of actual Vulcan names. Correct pronunciations using non-Vulcan phonemes, and accurate type-setting —using, for instance, the Roman alphabetical nucleus of the English language—had a tendency to prove non-native efforts to reproduce Vulcan family names highly inadequate.

            The Romulan language was used within the Romulan Star Empire. Its written form consists of square and rectangular letters. The spoken language had three dialects, and was difficult to distinguish from the Vulcan language to those not proficient in it. It was also known as Rihannsu. There was a joint project between the Romulan Reclamation Site and the Borg Reclamation Project, thus announcements, signage and crew conversations tended to be in both English and Romulan.
